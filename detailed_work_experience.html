    <h2>Research Collaborator - Self-Supervised Learning for CMS Experiment</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> February 2024 - Present</p>
        <p>
            In my current role as a Research Collaborator under the supervision of Dr. Sergei Gleyzer at the University of Alabama, I am actively involved in advancing self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques to enhance particle identification and event topology reconstruction for the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This experiment plays a pivotal role in searching for new physics by analyzing high-energy particle collisions.
            <br><br>
            My primary focus lies in developing innovative machine learning models capable of processing extensive datasets containing cropped images of simulated particle collision events. Each dataset comprises eight distinct image channels, shaped as 8 x 125 x 125, specifically designed to capture intricate details from the electron calorimeter and inner/outer tracker layers. These images are critical for identifying charged particles and understanding their interactions in the CMS detector.
            <br><br>
            I employ various SSL methodologies, such as contrastive learning and clustering, to leverage the vast amounts of high-quality unlabeled data available in particle physics. By pretraining encoder models on this unlabeled data, I aim to extract meaningful features that represent the underlying physical processes involved in particle collisions. This unsupervised learning phase allows the models to learn generalizable representations of the data, which can then be fine-tuned with limited labeled data for specific tasks, significantly improving performance over traditional supervised learning methods.
            <br><br>
            In addition to my primary tasks, I am also exploring the implementation of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) within transformer architectures to optimize performance for 2D outputs, such as images. This involves creating and testing autoencoder configurations that incorporate KAN layers, enabling the models to effectively capture complex patterns in the data while maintaining a focus on key features like particle directionality and curvature.
            <br><br>

            Through this multifaceted approach, I aim to contribute significantly to the CMS experiment's goals, facilitating better understanding and identification of collision events that could shed light on fundamental questions in particle physics.

    <h2>Research Collaborator - Heavy Rainfall Prediction Using ML</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> April 2024 - September 2024</p>
        <p>
            Under the guidance of Dr. Raju Attada, I worked on a critical project aimed at predicting heavy rainfall events in the Kedarnath area of North India, an area significantly impacted by devastating floods from June 13-17, 2013. These unpredictable floods resulted in substantial loss of life and property, underscoring the necessity for improved forecasting techniques to mitigate such risks.
            <br><br>
            Our project focused on leveraging various meteorological datasets, particularly ERA5 data, to analyze historical weather patterns and enhance the accuracy of extreme weather event predictions. We began by averaging the data across a grid of images representing 13 features, including 12 meteorological variables and a target variable of total precipitation. This preprocessing step allowed us to create a time series dataset, which served as the foundation for our predictive models.
            <br><br>
            Initially, we implemented several simple machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest Regressor, to establish baseline predictive capabilities. Encouraged by the initial results, we transitioned to more sophisticated models, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The LSTM-based models achieved an impressive accuracy exceeding 90%, effectively capturing anomalous weather patterns that typically precede extreme rainfall events.
            <br><br>
            To enhance our model's performance further, we retained the entire pixel data without averaging over latitude and longitude. This approach ensured that no valuable information was lost during the preprocessing phase. We expanded our analysis by developing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models, which also demonstrated remarkable results, achieving around 93% accuracy in predicting heavy rainfall events.
            <br><br>
            Currently, we are planning to collect additional data to refine our models further. This will involve conducting hyperparameter tuning tests to optimize model performance, ensuring that our predictive capabilities can provide timely early warnings for extreme weather events. The insights gained from this project aim to contribute to more effective disaster preparedness and response strategies in vulnerable regions like Kedarnath.

    <h2>Research Intern - X-ray Binaries Research</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> November 2023 - March 2024</p>
        <p>
            During my research internship under the supervision of Dr. Aru Beri at IISER Mohali, I focused on the investigation of neutron stars and black holes within X-ray binary systems. My primary responsibilities included extracting light curves from X-ray data obtained from satellite observations, which are essential for understanding the behavior of these enigmatic astrophysical objects. 
            <br><br>
            I applied various data filtering techniques to clean and preprocess the light curves, ensuring the reliability of the results for subsequent analysis. This process involved identifying and removing noise and instrumental artifacts, enabling a clearer understanding of the emission properties and temporal behavior of the neutron stars and black holes in these systems. 
            <br><br>
            This research is critical for elucidating the mechanisms behind X-ray emissions in extreme environments and contributes to the broader understanding of stellar evolution and the dynamics of compact objects in binary systems.

    <h2>Research Intern - SWGO Experiment Optimization</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> February 2023 - September 2023</p>
        <p>
            As an research intern, I worked closely with Dr. Tommaso Dorigo at the University of Padova and the INFN on optimizing key aspects of the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO). My contributions involved fine-tuning the experiment’s detection system to improve accuracy in capturing gamma-ray events, focusing specifically on the lateral distribution of secondary particles produced in extensive air showers.
            <br><br>
            During this collaboration, I conducted a study titled “Parametrization Model for Lateral Distribution of Secondary Particles in Extensive Air Showers.” I developed a machine learning-driven approach utilizing the Python library CurvPy to parametrize the lateral distribution of secondary particles. This innovative methodology not only enhances the understanding of particle interactions but also aids in optimizing detector layouts for improved detection sensitivity. 
            <br><br>
            I validated this approach by comparing the results with alternative models implemented in ROOT, a widely-used data analysis framework. This comparison demonstrated the effectiveness of my proposed method in accurately predicting the lateral distribution of secondary particles, which is essential for estimating the energy and direction of incoming gamma rays.
            <br><br>
            The implications of this research are significant, as they play a critical role in optimizing SWGO's array design. By strategically spacing thousands of detector units across several square kilometers, the observatory can maximize its ability to detect high-energy gamma rays. Furthermore, the outcomes of this work contribute valuable tools for reconstruction algorithms, detector optimization, and composition analyses in cosmic ray physics, paving the way for future advancements in this field.
